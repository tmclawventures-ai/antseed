# 04 - Payments: Streaming SpendingAuth

This document specifies the payment protocol for the AntSeed P2P AI compute network. Payments use USDC on Base with two EIP-712 signed messages: **ReserveAuth** (session budget) and **SpendingAuth** (cumulative per-request authorization). AntseedChannels orchestrates the lifecycle but holds no USDC — all funds stay in AntseedDeposits.

## 1. Session Lifecycle (Reserve → Serve → Settle/Close)

```

### Reserve

The buyer signs an EIP-712 `ReserveAuth` (channelId, maxAmount, deadline) and sends it to the seller over P2P. The seller calls `reserve()` on-chain, which verifies the buyer's signature and calls `Deposits.lockForChannel()` to lock the buyer's USDC. The channelId is `keccak256(abi.encode(buyer, seller, salt))`.

### Serve

During the session, the seller sends a `SellerReceipt` after each request. The buyer signs a `SpendingAuth` with the new cumulative amount and metadata hash. These form the authorization trail.

When the session budget is nearly exhausted, the seller settles (calls `close()`), returns HTTP 402, and the buyer initiates a new session negotiation with a fresh ReserveAuth.

### Settle / Close

The seller calls `settle()` with the latest SpendingAuth to charge the cumulative amount while keeping the session open. To finalize, the seller calls `close()`, which charges the final amount and releases remaining locked funds to the buyer.

### Timeout

If the seller disappears after the deadline, anyone can call `requestTimeout()`. After a 15-minute grace period, `withdraw()` releases the locked funds back to the buyer's deposit.

## 2. EIP-712 Signed Messages

EIP-712 domain for both message types:

```
name:               "AntseedChannels"
version:            "7"
chainId:            <deployment chain>
verifyingContract:  <channels contract address>
```

### ReserveAuth

```
ReserveAuth(
  bytes32 channelId,
  uint128 maxAmount,
  uint256 deadline
)
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `channelId` | `keccak256(abi.encode(buyer, seller, salt))` — unique per session |
| `maxAmount` | Maximum USDC (6 decimals) the seller may lock from the buyer's deposit |
| `deadline` | Unix timestamp after which this authorization and the session expire |

The buyer signs this off-chain. The seller submits it to `reserve()` along with buyer address, salt, maxAmount, and deadline.

### SpendingAuth

```
SpendingAuth(
  bytes32 channelId,
  uint256 cumulativeAmount,
  bytes32 metadataHash
)
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `channelId` | Same channel identifier as the ReserveAuth |
| `cumulativeAmount` | Total USDC authorized so far (monotonically increasing across requests) |
| `metadataHash` | Hash of request metadata (input/output tokens, model identifier, etc.) |

The buyer signs a new SpendingAuth after each request. The seller accumulates these and submits the latest to `settle()` or `close()`. Single signature per action — no dual signatures required.

## 3. Session Budget and Budget Exhaustion

The `maxAmount` in the ReserveAuth caps total USDC the seller can charge in a session. The buyer's SpendingAuth `cumulativeAmount` must not exceed this cap.

When the budget is nearly exhausted, the seller calls `close()` with the final SpendingAuth, returns HTTP 402 to the buyer, and the buyer initiates a new session negotiation with a fresh ReserveAuth and salt.

## 4. Per-Agent Stats (AntseedStats)

Channel metrics are tracked per ERC-8004 agentId in the AntseedStats contract. Stats are updated by AntseedChannels during `settle()` and `close()`:

- `channelCount` — number of completed channels
- `totalVolumeUsdc` — cumulative USDC volume
- `totalRequests` — cumulative request count

Stats are factual counters with no reputation scoring logic. They feed into emissions and staking calculations.

## 5. Anti-Gaming Defences

| Layer | Mechanism | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum deposit | Buyers must deposit at least N USDC to participate | 10 USDC |
| Minimum stake | Sellers must stake USDC bound to ERC-8004 agentId | 10 USDC |
| Budget binding | ReserveAuth binds maxAmount and deadline to buyer signature | Per-session |
| Cumulative auth | SpendingAuth cumulativeAmount is monotonically increasing | Per-request |
| Gasless buyer | Buyer never submits transactions — cannot be griefed for gas | Always |

## 6. Staking

Sellers must stake USDC via `stake(agentId, amount)` on `AntseedStaking`, binding their stake to an ERC-8004 agentId. Minimum stake: `MIN_SELLER_STAKE` (default: 10 USDC). An unstaked seller cannot have `reserve()` called — the transaction reverts.

## 7. Stats and Identity

### AntseedStats (on-chain metrics)

Factual per-agent session metrics updated by AntseedChannels during settlement. No reputation scoring — pure counters.

### ERC-8004 Identity and Feedback

Identity uses the deployed ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry (Base: `0x8004A169...`). Feedback uses the deployed ERC-8004 ReputationRegistry (Base: `0x8004BAa1...`). There is no custom AntseedIdentity contract.

### MockERC8004Registry

For local testing only. Simulates the ERC-8004 registry interface so contracts can be tested without a mainnet dependency.

## 8. Emission Distribution (ANTS Token)

### ANTS Token

ERC-20 on Base. No pre-mine. No initial supply. All ANTS distributed through verified work over 10 years.

**Phase 1 (current):** Non-transferable. `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` revert. Participants earn and claim but cannot trade. Owner calls `enableTransfers()` (one-way toggle) when the network matures.

Mint authority restricted to `AntseedEmissionsV2` contract (`setEmissionsContract()` — one-time setter).

### AntseedEmissionsV2

Deployed upgrade of the original `AntseedEmissions`. Backward-compatible with V1 by reading V1's genesis, epoch constants, and combining V1 + V2 points for the migration epoch and all earlier epochs.

- **Base mainnet address:** `0xF13bE52c4A3afC6AE29536f073588d01A0564088`
- **Genesis:** copied from V1 (`legacyEmissions.genesis()`)
- **Epoch duration / halving interval:** copied from V1

#### Epochs

Epochs advance automatically via block timestamp:

```
currentEpoch = (block.timestamp - genesis) / EPOCH_DURATION
```

No manual `advanceEpoch()` is required. Epoch parameters (share percentages and per-epoch caps) are snapshotted on first V2 touch of each epoch and remain immutable for that epoch.

#### Emission Split (per-epoch snapshot)

| Bucket | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Seller share | 65% | Rewards proven delivery |
| Buyer share | 25% | Rewards network usage and feedback |
| Reserve share | 10% | Future use (subscription pool staking, liquidity) |
| Team share | 0% | Protocol team |

#### Points Accrual

During `settle()` / `close()`, `AntseedChannels` calls one of:

- `accrueSellerPoints(seller, pointsDelta)`
- `accrueBuyerPoints(buyer, pointsDelta)`
- `accruePoints(channelId, buyer, seller, pointsDelta)` — optional pair-aware hook for future channels

For epochs `<= MIGRATION_EPOCH`, V1 points are combined with V2 points on claim. For later epochs, only V2 points are used.

#### Points Policy Hook

An optional `IAntseedPointsPolicy` can be set by owner. If set and its `points()` call succeeds, it returns weighted seller/buyer points. If not set, or if the call reverts, raw points are used.

#### Per-Epoch Pro-Rata Distribution

Claiming computes rewards per finalized epoch:

```
sellerBudget = epochEmission * sellerSharePct / 100
sellerReward = (userSellerPoints / epochTotalSellerPoints) * sellerBudget

buyerBudget  = epochEmission * buyerSharePct / 100
buyerReward  = (userBuyerPoints / epochTotalBuyerPoints) * buyerBudget
```

#### Per-Epoch Caps

- **Seller cap:** `maxSellerSharePct` (default historically ~15% of the seller bucket). Excess redirected to reserve.
- **Buyer cap:** `maxBuyerSharePct` (default 5% of the buyer bucket). Excess redirected to reserve.

#### Seller Claiming

Sellers call `claimSellerEmissions(epochs[])` for finalized epochs.

If `sellerUnlockPolicy.canClaimSellerUnlocked(seller)` returns true, ANTS are minted directly to the seller.

If the policy returns false (or is not set), ANTS are minted to `AntseedSellerRewardsPool` and recorded as locked for that seller. They remain locked until the unlock policy later allows release.

#### Buyer Claiming

Anyone can call `claimBuyerEmissions(buyer, epochs[])` provided `msg.sender == Deposits.getOperator(buyer)`. Reward is minted to `msg.sender`.

#### Reserve & Team

Reserve and team shares accumulate in the contract until flushed by owner:

- `flushReserve()` — mints accumulated reserve ANTS to `registry.protocolReserve()`
- `flushTeam()` — mints accumulated team ANTS to `registry.teamWallet()`

### Legacy V1 Backward Compatibility

`AntseedEmissionsV2` reads the legacy `AntseedEmissions` contract for:

- `genesis`, `EPOCH_DURATION`, `HALVING_INTERVAL`, `INITIAL_EMISSION`
- Claimed state for epochs `< MIGRATION_EPOCH`
- User points and total points for epochs `<= MIGRATION_EPOCH`

This ensures sellers and buyers do not lose historical points during the upgrade.

## 9. Subscription Pool

Separate contract (`AntseedSubPool`) managing subscription-based access. Evolves independently from the core deposits/channels/proof system.

- `subscribe(tier)` — buyer pays monthly fee in USDC
- `cancelSubscription()` — stops at end of current period
- `setTier(tierId, monthlyFee, dailyTokenBudget)` — owner configures tiers
- `optIn(agentId)` / `optOut(agentId)` — peers opt in/out of serving subscribers (requires ERC-8004 agentId)
- `claimRevenue(agentId)` — peer claims share proportional to stats
- `distributionEpoch()` — callable by anyone, distributes current epoch revenue
- Daily token budget enforcement per subscriber

## 10. Contract Architecture

```
ANTSToken (ERC-20)              ── mint restricted to AntseedEmissionsV2
AntseedDeposits                 ── buyer USDC deposits, holds ALL buyer USDC
AntseedChannels                 ── Reserve→Settle/Close lifecycle (holds NO USDC, swappable)
AntseedStaking                  ── seller stake bound to ERC-8004 agentId
AntseedStats                    ── factual per-agent session metrics
AntseedEmissionsV2              ── USDC volume-based epoch emissions (backward-compatible with V1)
AntseedSellerRewardsPool        ── holds locked ANTS for sellers pending unlock policy
AntseedSellerUnlockPolicy       ── on-chain policy determining if seller can claim unlocked
AntseedSubPool                  ── subscription tiers, daily budgets, revenue distribution
MockERC8004Registry             ── local testing only (mainnet: deployed ERC-8004)
```

Contracts reference each other by address (set at deployment, updateable by owner). No inheritance between contracts — only interface calls.

**Interaction flow:**
- `AntseedChannels` calls `AntseedDeposits.lockForChannel()` on reserve
- `AntseedChannels` calls `AntseedDeposits.chargeAndCreditPayouts()` on settle/close
- `AntseedChannels` calls `AntseedStats.updateStats()` on settle/close
- `AntseedChannels` calls `AntseedEmissionsV2.accrueSellerPoints()` / `accrueBuyerPoints()` on settle/close
- `AntseedChannels` reads from `AntseedStaking` (seller stake verification)
- `AntseedEmissionsV2` calls `ANTSToken.mint()` on claim

## 11. P2P Messages

| Type | Name | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x50 | `ReserveAuth` | Buyer → Seller | EIP-712 signed reserve authorization |
| 0x51 | `AuthAck` | Seller → Buyer | Reservation confirmed |
| 0x53 | `SellerReceipt` | Seller → Buyer | Running-total receipt after each request |
| 0x54 | `SpendingAuth` | Buyer → Seller | EIP-712 signed cumulative spending authorization |

## 12. Session Persistence

Session state is persisted to SQLite in the node SDK. Schema:

- `sessions` table: channel_id, peer_id, role, EVM addresses, salt, max_amount, deadline, cumulative_amount, request_count, timestamps, status
- `receipts` table: channel_id, cumulative_amount, request_count, metadata_hash, seller_sig, buyer_spending_auth_sig, timestamp

## 13. Supported Chains

| Chain ID | Network | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base-sepolia` | Base Sepolia testnet | Testing and development |
| `base-mainnet` | Base mainnet | Production |
