# Connect Hermes to AntSeed

Set up AntSeed as the model backend for a Hermes agent. Hermes is the agent framework (successor to OpenClaw) and AntSeed is a P2P network of AI service providers. The buyer proxy runs next to Hermes and routes its LLM calls through the network.

This skill replaces `openclaw-antseed`, which is stale.

## Picture

```
Hermes agent  →  127.0.0.1:8377  →  AntSeed P2P  →  Provider peer  →  Upstream API
                 (buyer proxy)      (on-chain payment channels)
```

- Buyer proxy discovers providers via DHT, opens a payment channel per seller, signs per-request vouchers.
- Exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/*` endpoint — that's what Hermes points at as `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.
- The model ID Hermes passes is the AntSeed **service ID** (e.g. `minimax-m2.7`), not an OpenAI model name.

The buyer proxy and Hermes can run on the same machine (laptop, VPS, cloud box — anywhere). The only requirement is that Hermes can reach `127.0.0.1:8377`.

## Before you start

Ask the user anything you don't already have:

- **Where Hermes is running** — same machine you're acting on, or a remote host you reach over SSH. Most setup steps are identical; remote hosts just need everything prefixed with `ssh user@host`.
- **Chain** — `base-mainnet` for real funds, `base-sepolia` for testnet. Default to `base-mainnet` unless the user says otherwise.

---

## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @antseed/cli
antseed --version
```

Requires Node.js 20+. Latest version: `npm view @antseed/cli version`. A global `npm install` can take 1–3 minutes — use a long timeout.

## Chain configuration

Always create `~/.antseed/config.json` with `payments.crypto.chainId` set. Without it, the `antseed buyer deposit` CLI command fails with "No crypto payment configuration found" and the buyer proxy cannot open payment channels.

```json
{
  "network": {},
  "buyer": {
    "minPeerReputation": 0,
    "maxPricing": {
      "defaults": {
        "inputUsdPerMillion": 100,
        "outputUsdPerMillion": 100
      }
    }
  },
  "payments": {
    "preferredMethod": "crypto",
    "crypto": {
      "chainId": "base-mainnet"
    }
  }
}
```

**Do not hardcode contract addresses.** `@antseed/node` resolves Deposits, Channels, USDC, and the RPC URL from `chainId` via its built-in chain-config presets. Hardcoded addresses drift when contracts redeploy; the preset is the source of truth.

To switch chains later, edit only `chainId` (`base-mainnet` ↔ `base-sepolia`) and restart the buyer.

## Identity and the buyer wallet

The buyer needs an EVM identity — a 32-byte secp256k1 private key supplied via the `ANTSEED_IDENTITY_HEX` env var (64 hex chars, optional `0x` prefix), or already present in `~/.antseed/identity.key`.

The EVM address derived from that key is your **buyer wallet**. It only needs:

- **USDC on the target chain** — used as payment channel reserves, deposited via the payments portal

**The buyer wallet does NOT need ETH or any native token for gas.** All on-chain transactions (channel reserve, settle, close) are initiated by the seller. The buyer only signs off-chain messages.

**Never move `identity.key` off the host that runs the buyer.** The hot wallet stays put. Funding happens via the payments portal running on that host (see next section), not by exporting the key to a wallet app on another machine.

Check balance any time:

```bash
antseed buyer balance
```

## Running the buyer proxy

Foreground, for a laptop or a quick test:

```bash
antseed buyer start
```

For an isolated Hermes buyer, use a dedicated data directory. This is where AntSeed writes `buyer.state.json`, SQLite databases, payment-channel state, and the fallback `identity.key`:

```bash
export BUYDIR="$HOME/.antseed-buyer-hermes"
mkdir -p "$BUYDIR"
ANTSEED_DATA_DIR="$BUYDIR" antseed --data-dir "$BUYDIR" buyer start
```

Advanced: if Hermes must use a non-default proxy port:

```bash
antseed --data-dir "$BUYDIR" buyer start --port 5005
```

Persistent (Linux, systemd):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/antseed-buyer.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=AntSeed Buyer Proxy
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=$USER
Environment=ANTSEED_IDENTITY_HEX=<64-hex-no-0x>
Environment=ANTSEED_DATA_DIR=%h/.antseed-buyer-hermes

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now antseed-buyer
```

The service user must own the `~/.antseed/` directory that holds `config.json` and `identity.key`.

The buyer startup log prints the Deposits/Channels addresses and RPC URL it bound to — glance at those to confirm it's on the chain you expected.

## Funding via the payments portal

`antseed payments` starts a local web UI bound to `127.0.0.1:3118`, protected by a random bearer token printed once at startup. Use it to deposit USDC, view channel state, and withdraw.

```bash
antseed payments
# Payments portal running at http://127.0.0.1:3118?token=<hex>
```

Open the printed URL in a browser **with the `?token=...` query string intact** — the frontend reads the token from `window.location.search` exactly once and caches it. If you land on `/` without the token, every API call returns 401.

The token rotates on every portal restart. If you've restarted the portal and the browser starts returning 401s, tell the user to close the tab fully and reopen with the new URL — a refresh alone won't drop the cached token.

From the portal, the user connects an external wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) and signs the deposit transaction there. USDC flows from the user's cold wallet into the Deposits contract, credited to the buyer address.

### Two addresses — do not confuse them

The portal UI shows the **Deposits contract address** as the USDC destination. This is a smart contract, not the buyer wallet. Do not send ETH or any other token to this address — only USDC.

| Address | What it is | What to send |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Shown in portal | Deposits contract | USDC only |
| `antseed buyer balance` → Wallet | Buyer wallet | Nothing — buyer needs no gas |

After depositing, confirm with `antseed buyer balance` — the "Deposits Account → Available" line should reflect your deposit.

### When Hermes runs on a remote host

If the buyer runs on a remote box, `127.0.0.1:3118` isn't reachable from the user's browser directly. Start the portal on the remote host detached, then SSH-forward the port to the user's laptop.

Start the portal remotely so it survives the SSH call returning:

```bash
ssh user@host "nohup antseed payments > /tmp/antseed-payments.log 2>&1 </dev/null & disown"
ssh user@host "cat /tmp/antseed-payments.log"   # read back the bearer token
```

A bare `ssh user@host "antseed payments &"` will die on disconnect — always `nohup` + `disown` + redirect stdio.

Then open a local forward on the user's laptop:

```bash
ssh -N -L 127.0.0.1:3118:127.0.0.1:3118 user@host
```

Bind the left-hand side explicitly to `127.0.0.1:` — omitting the host lets OpenSSH pick IPv6-only, which many browsers then fail to reach.

Give the user `http://127.0.0.1:3118/?token=<hex>` (the URL from the portal log). The browser hits the local forward, which reaches the remote portal.

If `ssh -L` fails with `channel 1: open failed: administratively prohibited`, the remote sshd has `AllowTcpForwarding no`. Enable it in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (or a drop-in under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`), run `sudo sshd -t` to validate, then `sudo systemctl reload sshd`. Existing SSH sessions are not dropped by the reload.

## Pick a peer

The buyer proxy does not auto-select peers. Every request is rejected with `no_peer_pinned` until a peer is pinned — you must pick one explicitly.

List the network, find a peer that serves the model you want, and pin it:

```bash
antseed network browse                              # table of peers and their services
antseed network peer <peerId>                       # full details for one peer
antseed buyer connection set --peer <peerId>        # pin it for this session
```

Alternatively, pass `x-antseed-pin-peer: <peerId>` as a per-request header if the caller can inject headers.

**The pinned peer is session-only and is cleared when the buyer proxy restarts.** For non-systemd setups (desktop app, background process), re-run `antseed buyer connection set --peer <peerId>` after every restart.

For persistent systemd deployments, put `--peer <peerId>` in the `ExecStart=` line instead — it survives restarts and avoids a stale state file.

## Wiring Hermes to the buyer proxy

Register AntSeed as a custom provider in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and point `model.default` at an AntSeed service ID. Hermes reads this file at startup; nothing needs to be in `.env` for the AntSeed route itself.

```yaml
model:
  default: minimax-m2.7
  provider: antseed

custom_providers:
  - name: antseed
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8377/v1
    api_key: antseed-p2p
    api_mode: chat_completions
    models:
      - deepseek-v3.1
      - minimax-m2.7
      - kimi-k2.5
      - glm-5.1
      - qwen3-coder-next
```

Notes:

- `base_url` must match the buyer proxy port. Default is `8377`; if you started the buyer with `--port 5005`, use `http://127.0.0.1:5005/v1` here instead.
- `api_key` is required by Hermes' OpenAI client but ignored by the buyer proxy — any non-empty string works. `antseed-p2p` is the convention.
- `api_mode: chat_completions` is required — the buyer proxy speaks OpenAI chat-completions, not the Responses API.
- `models` is the menu Hermes exposes to the user; only IDs listed here can be selected. Mirror it against `antseed network browse` (or `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8377/v1/models`) so you don't advertise models no peer serves.
- `model.default` is the one Hermes uses when no explicit model is passed; `model.provider: antseed` pins it to this custom provider.

### Auxiliary calls when using openai-responses models

Some peers (e.g. Dark Signal) serve GPT models via the `openai-responses` protocol, which requires streaming. Hermes auxiliary functions (title generation, context compression, etc.) make non-streaming requests and will fail with `HTTP 400: Stream must be set to true` if they hit an openai-responses model.

Fix: point Hermes auxiliaries at a `chat_completions` model from the same or a different peer. In `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, override the auxiliary providers that make non-streaming calls:

```yaml
auxiliary:
  title_generation:
    provider: antseed
    model: minimax-m2.7   # chat_completions protocol — no streaming requirement
  compression:
    provider: antseed
    model: minimax-m2.7
```

Check which protocol a model uses with `antseed network peer <peerId>` — look for `protocols: openai-chat-completions` vs `protocols: openai-responses` in the service listing.

### Swapping the routed model

If you switch to a model the currently-pinned peer doesn't serve, re-pin to a peer that does (`antseed network browse` → `antseed buyer connection set --peer <peerId>`) before the next request. Then edit `model.default` (and the `models` list if needed) and restart the Hermes systemd unit — the buyer proxy stays up, no CLI change, no contract call:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart hermes
sudo journalctl -u hermes --no-pager -n 20
```

On a remote host, the same two commands prefixed with `ssh user@host`.

## Sanity check

```bash
antseed buyer balance                            # funds are present
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8377/v1/models | head   # buyer proxy is answering
```

Then send a prompt through Hermes and watch the buyer log — you should see a channel open on the first request, then per-request voucher signing.
