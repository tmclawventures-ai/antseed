# CLI Commands

### Getting started

```bash title="setup"
antseed seller setup                  Initialize seller onboarding
antseed buyer start                   Start the buyer proxy
```

In normal use, you configure the node once with `antseed seller setup` or `antseed config ...`, then start it later with `antseed seller start` or `antseed buyer start` without repeating flags every time. Secrets such as API keys stay in env vars; provider definitions, services, pricing, and `baseUrl` live in `~/.antseed/config.json`.
