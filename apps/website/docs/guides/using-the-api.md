# Using the API

Once connected to the AntSeed network, your buyer proxy exposes a local API at `http://localhost:8377`. Point any AI tool at this endpoint — the proxy handles peer discovery, routing, and payments transparently.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @antseed/cli

# 2. Set your identity
export ANTSEED_IDENTITY_HEX=<your-private-key-hex>

# 3. Start the buyer proxy
antseed buyer start
# Proxy listening on http://localhost:8377

# 4. Pick a peer to route through
antseed network browse                              # list peers + services
antseed buyer connection set --peer <40-char-hex>   # pin one

# 5. Deposit USDC when you want to pay providers
antseed payments
# Open http://localhost:3118, connect a funded wallet, deposit USDC
```

Until a peer is pinned, every request returns `no_peer_pinned` — there is no auto-selection. See [Pick a peer](#pick-a-peer) below.

`antseed buyer start` does not require a pre-existing `~/.antseed/config.json`. If the file is missing, the CLI starts with built-in defaults such as router `local` and proxy port `8377`.

## Buyer state isolation

Buyer runtime state is stored in the CLI data directory. By default this is `~/.antseed`, where the proxy writes `buyer.state.json`, SQLite databases, payment-channel files, and the fallback `identity.key`.

For multiple buyer nodes, service integrations, isolated tests, or concurrent processes, give each buyer its own data directory:

```bash
export BUYDIR="$HOME/.antseed-buyer-myapp"
mkdir -p "$BUYDIR"

ANTSEED_DATA_DIR="$BUYDIR" \
antseed --data-dir "$BUYDIR" buyer start \
  --peer <peer-id> \
  --port 8380
```

Use `--data-dir <path>` in service/systemd scripts because it is explicit. `ANTSEED_DATA_DIR=<path>` is useful for wrappers and local scripts. Do not reuse the same buyer data directory across concurrent processes.

If the buyer proxy starts but appears to use stale pins, waits on broad discovery, times out before payment negotiation, or shows sessions/channels in an unexpected place, check the startup log for the resolved data directory and `buyer.state.json` path. `ANTSEED_HOME` is not the CLI state-isolation setting; use `--data-dir` or `ANTSEED_DATA_DIR`.

Extra buyer config is optional. Add it only for advanced customization such as pricing caps, reputation thresholds, bootstrap nodes, or chain settings:

```json
{
  "buyer": {
    "minPeerReputation": 0,
    "maxPricing": {
      "defaults": {
        "inputUsdPerMillion": 25,
        "outputUsdPerMillion": 75
      }
    }
  },
  "payments": {
    "preferredMethod": "crypto",
    "crypto": {
      "chainId": "base-mainnet"
    }
  }
}
```

With a config file like that in place, the startup command is still just:

```bash
antseed buyer start
```

## Supported API Formats

The proxy accepts three API formats. Use whichever matches your tool:

| Endpoint | Format | Compatible Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API | Claude Code, Claude SDK |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions | Codex, any OpenAI-compatible client |
| `/v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses API | Codex |

The `model` field in your request determines which service to route to. The proxy finds the best available provider for that service on the network.

## Claude Code

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8377
claude
```

Claude Code sends requests to `/v1/messages` and the proxy routes them to the best available Anthropic provider on the network.

## Codex

Recent Codex versions (0.40+) ignore `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` and only read `~/.codex/config.toml`. See the [Codex integration page](/integrations/codex) for the profile-based setup, the routing-verification check, and known gotchas (project-local configs, `-c` flag pitfalls).

## curl

```bash
# Anthropic format
curl http://localhost:8377/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'

# OpenAI format
curl http://localhost:8377/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-v3.1",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'
```

## Pick a peer

The buyer proxy does not auto-select peers. Every request returns `no_peer_pinned` until you pin one — this keeps routing predictable and puts pricing/quality choice in your hands.

```bash
# List peers and the services each one offers
antseed network browse

# Inspect one peer in detail (pricing, protocols, on-chain stats)
antseed network peer <40-char-hex-peer-id>

# Pin a peer for the session (survives daemon restart)
antseed buyer connection set --peer <40-char-hex-peer-id>

# Pin a service too — overrides the `model` field in all requests
antseed buyer connection set --service claude-opus-4-6

# Clear pins
antseed buyer connection clear
```

You can also pin per-request by sending the `x-antseed-pin-peer: <peerId>` header — useful when different calls should go to different peers.

## How Routing Works

When you send a request:

1. The proxy verifies a peer is pinned; if not, it returns `no_peer_pinned`.
2. It checks the pinned peer's metadata for the requested `model` (the service name).
3. The request is forwarded to that peer via encrypted WebRTC.
4. The response streams back through the proxy.

## No API Key Needed

The proxy does not require an API key. Authentication and payments are handled by the protocol using your node's identity key and on-chain USDC deposits. Tools that require an API key (like Codex) can use any placeholder value.

## Monitor Buyer Usage

Expose buyer metrics with:

```bash
antseed metrics serve --role buyer
```

See [Metrics](/docs/guides/metrics) for buyer spend, channel, request, token, and per-peer metrics.
