# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to AntSeed packages are documented here.

This project uses selective package publishing. Each release entry lists the published packages affected by that release.

## 2026-05-07 — Payment channel catch-up fixes

### Published

- `@antseed/node@0.2.81`
- `@antseed/payments@0.1.15`
- `@antseed/cli@0.1.114`

### Fixed

- Fixed repeated payment catch-up loops when delivered seller spend exactly matched the last accepted buyer `SpendingAuth`.
- Prevented sellers from requesting `SpendingAuth` above delivered spend during catch-up.
- Stopped sellers from serving additional paid requests once an exactly settled channel has reached its reserve ceiling.

## 2026-05-07 — Payment accounting and seller close fixes

### Published

- `@antseed/node@0.2.80`
- `@antseed/payments@0.1.14`
- `@antseed/cli@0.1.113`

### Fixed

- Fixed seller-side `NeedAuth` accounting so post-response authorization requests only the cumulative delivered spend instead of double-counting the latest request.
- Fixed stale buyer `NeedAuth` handling so service-specific pricing context is preserved for the real authorization request.
- Prevented duplicate in-flight seller channel close attempts under concurrent cleanup paths.
